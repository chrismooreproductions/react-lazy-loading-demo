Hi there,

Thank you for taking the opportunity to review some of my code.

I produced this demo in a couple of hours on 10/3/2019.

To get started please run `npm install` from the root of the project.

You have a couple of options to run the project:
  - `npm run start` for the development build (which also enables webpack-dev-server for live reloading)
  - `npm run build` for the production build which builds a minified version of the code in the `./dist` directory.

Thanks! I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Chris
